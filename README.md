# CIRCUITPY-Workshop-Facilitator
Repo for workshop facilitator in case their device gets corrupted. Contains all working code from basic project 0, Meatball project 1, BME680 project 2, APDS project 3, Snake game project 4, Donkey Kong project 5, Super Mario Bros project 6. Also contains all required libraries, sprites, BMP, WAV files, as well as PDF schematics.

For Super Mario Bros, in the folder Demo-6_SuperMarioBros there is a file  called sprite_generator.py. Run this program on your HOST computer to create the sprites for SMB.
Then copy the generated BMP files to the Sprites folder on D:\CIRCUITPY.
Read the instructions at the top of the file for dependencies.

You may notice a folder Bluey_Family. Ths contains a BMP and code to display the BMP file. This is primarily to show the quality & resolution of the display. If you want, you can take a photo of yourself, crop it to 240x135 pixels (I just used MS Paint) and display it. Dont forget to change the code to open your new picture!
